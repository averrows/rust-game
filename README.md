this is my own repository to capture the journey of learning rust through game development (the reverse is valid too).

this repository predominantly reference [Herbert Wolverson](https://twitter.com/herberticus)'s work, [*Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play*](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/)
